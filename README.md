Hello World in React+Flux+ReactRouter
-------------------------------------

Application technologies:

- React
- Flux
- ReactRouter

Build/Deploy technologies:

- gulp (node + npm)
- browserify
- babelify (ES6 transformer)

The only goal here is to mash a bunch of well respected components
into the Flux and React way of doing things.
